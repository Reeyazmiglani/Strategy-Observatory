## When Uncertainty Becomes the Baseline

### 1. Context

I read today that the World Uncertainty Index hit 106,862 in February 2026, which is reportedly higher than the peaks during COVID, the 2008 financial crisis, and even 9/11. That genuinely surprised me. Those events felt enormous. COVID shut down the world. The 2008 crisis broke the financial system. 9/11 reshaped geopolitics. So how can uncertainty now be even higher? Then I thought about it differently. Those were intense but concentrated shocks. What we are experiencing now does not feel like one massive crisis. It feels like constant background instability. Elections, wars, trade tensions, regulatory shifts, supply chain realignments. Nothing fully collapses, but nothing feels settled either.

Maybe the real shift is not that uncertainty is extreme. It is that uncertainty is persistent.

### 2. What Is Actually Happening

When economists talk about uncertainty, they refer to higher risk premiums and lower investment confidence. That sounds abstract, but the intuition is simple.

Think of it this way. Imagine planning something long term, like booking a non refundable trip, but every few weeks the rules keep changing. Visa policies shift. Exchange rates move sharply. Flights get rerouted. Even if you can afford it, you hesitate.

That hesitation is what uncertainty does to capital. When trade rules change frequently, when geopolitical alliances shift, and when regulatory frameworks evolve unpredictably, firms delay irreversible decisions. Money does not disappear in uncertain times. It becomes cautious. It demands more cushion before committing. Capital starts asking a simple question. What if something changes again?

### 3. Who Gains, Who Feels Pressure

In high uncertainty environments, stability becomes valuable. Firms with strong balance sheets, diversified supply chains, and pricing power suddenly look more attractive. Large firms often benefit first because they can absorb shocks more easily. They can delay projects, shift production across regions, and rely on liquidity buffers. Export oriented firms with geographic diversification may also navigate volatility better than firms dependent on a single market. Smaller firms feel every tremor more sharply. One supply disruption or one regulatory change can meaningfully impact margins. Flexibility becomes essential, but flexibility requires capital. Optionality is expensive. Over time, this environment can quietly increase concentration. Investors and counterparties begin trusting the firms that look stable, and that trust compounds.

### 4. Bigger Strategic Angle

If uncertainty becomes normal rather than temporary, competitive advantage changes. For years, efficiency was everything. Lowest cost structures, lean supply chains, maximum optimization. Now resilience competes directly with efficiency. A slightly more expensive but more reliable supply chain may be preferable to the cheapest possible one. Think about two routes to college. One is shorter but frequently blocked. The other is slightly longer but consistently open. In a predictable world, you choose the shorter route. In an unpredictable world, reliability starts to matter more. That shift changes strategy. Companies may prioritize robustness over pure cost minimization. Investors may begin pricing reliability as a premium trait rather than a conservative one.

### 5. What This Means for Capital

If this environment persists, a few patterns seem likely:

• Higher hurdle rates before committing to long term, irreversible investments  
• Greater emphasis on liquidity and balance sheet strength  
• More capital flowing toward sectors perceived as stable or defensive  
• Slower, more deliberate investment cycles  

At the same time, uncertainty does not eliminate opportunity. It redistributes it. Firms that can operate confidently in volatile conditions may gain disproportionate advantage.

### Closing Thought

What stands out to me is that there is no single event to wait out this time. There is no clear moment when everything resets. If instability becomes the baseline, strategy adjusts. Valuations adjust. Expectations adjust.

Maybe the structural shift is not one dramatic crisis. Maybe it is learning to compete in a world where unpredictability is normal, and realizing that in such a world, stability itself becomes a competitive advantage.
