# Capital & Competition

Markets move. Capital reallocates. Strategies adapt.

This repository tracks how economic shocks, policy shifts, earnings surprises, and competitive decisions reshape industries and firm positioning.


Each entry breaks down:

What changed

Why it mattered

How markets responded

What it implies for competitive advantage and long-term value creation

The focus is not just on price movements, but on the structural forces driving them.
